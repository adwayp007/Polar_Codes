## Introduction

Polar codes are a family of error-correcting codes that achieve the capacity of binary-input memoryless symmetric channels under successive cancellation decoding. This project provides MATLAB implementations for polar encoding, decoding using successive cancellation decoding, and supporting utility functions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `polar_encoder.m`: MATLAB script for polar encoding.
- `polar_scd_decoder.m`: MATLAB script for polar decoding using successive cancellation decoding.
- `likelihood_cal.m`: MATLAB script for likelihood calculation used in decoding.
- `polar_channel_probs.m`: MATLAB script for calculating channel probabilities in the polar encoding process.
- `master_polar.m`: MATLAB script as a master function for the polar encoder.
- Other utility functions: Various utility functions used in the encoding and decoding processes.
